# machine-learning-for-portfolio-management-and-trading

This material is an introduction to using machine-learning for portfolio management and trading. Given the centrality of programming in hedge funds today, the concepts are exposed using only jupyter notebooks in python. Moreover, we leverage the scikit-learn package (also known as sklearn) to illustrate how machine-learning is used in practice in this context.

Note: 
- in the `book` folder, the book.pdf file is created from the notebooks in the `nbs` folder from .tex files based on a template in the `template` folder. 
- more precisely, running "python nb2book/make_book.py" from the root of the repo generates the book.pdf file.
